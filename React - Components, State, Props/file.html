10.How to Create a List View in React Js?
=> In React, you will render lists with some type of loop.
The JavaScript map() array method is generally the preferred method.
When you run this code in your create-react-app, it will work but you will receive a warning that there is no "key" provided for the list items.
Key
Keys allow React to keep track of elements. This way, if an item is updated or removed, only that item will be re-rendered instead of the entire list.
Keys need to be unique to each sibling. But they can be duplicated globally.
Generally, the key should be a unique ID assigned to each item. As a last resort, you can use the array index as a key.
